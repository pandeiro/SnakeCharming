# **Project Assignment: F1 Braking & Corner Entry Simulator**

## **Project Overview**

**Objective:** Build a Python program that models F1 car braking dynamics under traction limits and finds the optimal braking point for corner entry. This project teaches you how mechanical engineers analyze vehicle dynamics, tire grip limits, and race strategy—skills applicable to autonomous vehicle control, motorsports engineering, or any system with friction-limited motion.

**Tools:** Google Colab (colab.research.google.com)

**Estimated Time:** 3-6 hours total (can be spread over multiple sessions)

---

## **Objectives**

By completing this project, you will learn to:
1. **Apply** Newton's 2nd law in a friction-limited deceleration context
2. **Model** tire grip limits and the friction circle concept
3. **Calculate** time-to-stop and distance-to-stop under maximum braking
4. **Optimize** braking points for corner entry ("how late can you brake?")
5. **Visualize** braking zones and compare different strategies
6. **Analyze** the trade-offs between braking late and corner entry speed

---

## **Stage 1A: Understanding F1 Braking Physics**

### **Learning Focus: Core Deceleration Concepts**

**Time Estimate:** 1-1.5 hours

**What You'll Build:** A simple calculator that computes how long it takes an F1 car to stop from a given speed.

**Assignment:**
1. Create a new Colab notebook titled `F1_Braking_Simulator`
2. Calculate stopping time and distance for an F1 car braking from 200 km/h

---

### **Step-by-Step Instructions:**

**Step 1A: Import Required Libraries**

It's our old friends numpy and matplot!

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

**What this does:**
- `numpy` provides mathematical functions and arrays
- `matplotlib.pyplot` creates plots and visualizations

**Step 1B: Define Colors**
- `COLORS` dictionary will ensure all our plots use consistent color coding (like a pro F1 engineering team would)

```python
# F1 Data Visualization Color Palette
# We'll reference these colors consistently throughout for professional-looking plots
COLORS = {
    'f1_red': '#E10600',          # Dry conditions / optimal performance
    'wet_blue': '#0066CC',        # Wet conditions
    'rain_green': '#00CC66',      # Very wet / heavy rain conditions
    'damp_orange': '#FF9900',     # Damp / intermediate conditions
    'reference_black': '#1A1A1A'  # Reference lines and baselines
}
```

**Pro tip:** Using a color palette makes your data instantly recognizable. When you see F1 red, you'll know it's dry/optimal. Blue always means wet. This is standard practice in engineering visualization.

---

**Step 2: Define Physical Constants**

Let's start with the fundamental constants:

```python
# Physical constants
g = 9.81  # gravitational acceleration (m/s²)

# F1 tire grip - fill in a reasonable value:
mu = ???  # coefficient of friction - F1 slick tires (hint: between 1.8 and 2.2)
<!-- PARTIAL_REVEAL -->
# Complete solution:
g = 9.81   # gravitational acceleration (m/s²)
mu = 2.0   # coefficient of friction - modern F1 slick tires

# **Why mu = 2.0?**
# F1 slick tires in optimal conditions provide 1.8-2.2g of grip
# We'll use 2.0 as a typical "good conditions" value
```

---

### **⚠️ IMPORTANT PHYSICS NOTE: Why μ > 1 for F1 Tires**

**You might be thinking:** "Wait, I learned in physics class that friction coefficients are always less than 1!"

**That's true for simple materials** (like wood on wood, or a book on a table), but **F1 tires are special**:

**Three reasons F1 tires can exceed μ = 1:**

1. **Soft rubber compounds:** F1 tire rubber is so soft it almost "sticks" to the track surface chemically, not just through mechanical friction. The rubber literally bonds to the asphalt at a molecular level.

2. **Tire deformation:** When an F1 tire loads up under braking, it deforms and creates a contact patch that mechanically interlocks with the track surface texture—creating grip beyond simple friction.

3. **Aerodynamic downforce:** F1 cars generate massive downforce (up to 5× the car's weight at high speed!), which increases the normal force pressing the tire into the track. More normal force = more grip available.

**The result:** Modern F1 slicks can generate μ = 1.8-2.2 in optimal conditions—that's nearly **2g of deceleration!** This is why F1 cars can brake from 200 km/h to a near-stop in less than 80 meters, while a road car would need 200+ meters.

**For comparison:**
- Road car tires: μ ≈ 0.7-0.9
- Racing slicks (optimal): μ ≈ 1.8-2.2
- F1 in the wet: μ ≈ 1.0-1.4
- Road car in the wet: μ ≈ 0.4-0.6

So when you see μ = 2.0 in this project, that's not an error—that's the incredible reality of F1 tire technology!

---

**Step 3: Set Initial Speed**

Now define the speed we're braking from:

```python
# Initial speed - fill in the value:
v0_kmh = ???  # km/h - try a typical corner approach speed (150-250 km/h)
<!-- PARTIAL_REVEAL -->
# Our recommendation (but this can be changed!):
v0_kmh = 200  # km/h - approaching a medium-speed corner

# **Why 200 km/h?**
# This is realistic for corners like:
# - Monza's first chicane
# - Barcelona's Turn 1
# - Austin's Turn 12
```

---

**Step 4: Convert Speed and Calculate Maximum Deceleration**

Physics works in m/s, not km/h, so we need to convert:

```python
# Convert km/h to m/s - fill in the conversion:
v0 = v0_kmh / ???
<!-- PARTIAL_REVEAL -->
# Complete solution:
v0 = v0_kmh / 3.6  # Convert: 200 km/h = 55.56 m/s

# **The conversion:**
# 1 km/h = 1000m / 3600s = 1/3.6 m/s
# So to convert km/h → m/s, divide by 3.6
```

Now calculate the maximum deceleration:

```python
# Fill in the deceleration formula:
a_max = ???  # Maximum deceleration formula?
<!-- PARTIAL_REVEAL -->
# Complete solution:
a_max = mu * g     # Maximum deceleration = 2.0 × 9.81 = 19.62 m/s²

# **The physics:**
# From F = ma and F_max = μmg:
# a_max = F_max / m = (μmg) / m = μg
# Notice: mass (m) cancelled out!
# This means a 798kg F1 car and a 900kg F1 car stop in the same distance
# (assuming same tires and conditions)
```

**Engineering Insight:** The fact that deceleration is independent of mass is counterintuitive but true! A heavy car and light car stop in the same distance with the same tires. However, the heavy car's brakes work harder (more kinetic energy to dissipate as heat).

---

**Step 5: Calculate Stopping Time**

Use the kinematic equation v = v₀ - at. When the car stops, v = 0:

```python
# Fill in the stopping time formula:
# Starting from: v = v0 - a*t
# When stopped: 0 = v0 - a*t

# Solve for t: t = ???
t_stop = ??? / ???
<!-- PARTIAL_REVEAL -->
# Solve for t: t = ???
t_stop = v0 / a_max  # Time to stop: t = v0 / a

# **The algebra, explained:**
# v = v0 - at
# At stop: 0 = v0 - a*t
# Rearrange: a*t = v0
# Solve: t = v0 / a
```

---

**Step 6: Calculate Stopping Distance**

Use the kinematic equation v² = v₀² - 2ad. When the car stops, v = 0:

```python
# Fill in the stopping distance formula:
# Starting from: v² = v0² - 2*a*d
# When stopped: 0 = v0² - 2*a*d

# Solve for d: d = ???
d_stop = ???**2 / (2 * ???)   # ** in python is the exponent operand btw
<!-- PARTIAL_REVEAL -->
# Solve for d: d = ???
d_stop = v0**2 / (2 * a_max)  # Distance to stop: d = v0² / (2a)

# **The algebra:**
# v² = v0² - 2ad
# At stop: 0 = v0² - 2ad
# Rearrange: 2ad = v0²
# Solve: d = v0² / (2a)
```

**Physics reminder:** These are the standard kinematic equations:
- **v = v₀ - at** (velocity during constant deceleration)
- **v² = v₀² - 2ad** (velocity-displacement relationship)

---

**Step 7: Display Results**

Here we go, the fun part:

(Note: if you want to change your initial speed, go back and do that and run all cells again,
and this will all change.)

```python
# Print the results
print("=" * 50)
print("F1 BRAKING ANALYSIS")
print("=" * 50)
print(f"Initial speed: {v0_kmh} km/h ({v0:.2f} m/s)")
print(f"Tire grip (μ): {mu}")
print(f"Maximum deceleration: {a_max:.2f} m/s² ({a_max/g:.2f}g)")
print(f"Time to stop: {t_stop:.2f} seconds")
print(f"Stopping distance: {d_stop:.2f} meters")
print("=" * 50)
```

---

### **Checkpoint #1**

**What you should see:** Output showing:
- Initial speed: 200 km/h (55.56 m/s)
- Maximum deceleration: ~19.62 m/s² (2.0g)
- Time to stop: ~2.83 seconds
- Stopping distance: ~78.6 meters

**Reality Check:**
An F1 car braking from 200 km/h to 0 in under 3 seconds over less than 80 meters demonstrates the incredible grip of F1 slick tires!

**Comparison Challenge:**
```python
# How does a road car compare?
mu_road = 0.8  # Road car tires
a_road = mu_road * g
t_road = v0 / a_road
d_road = v0**2 / (2 * a_road)

print(f"\nRoad car (μ={mu_road}):")
print(f"  Time to stop: {t_road:.2f}s (+{t_road - t_stop:.2f}s)")
print(f"  Distance: {d_road:.1f}m (+{d_road - d_stop:.1f}m)")
print(f"  F1 is {d_road/d_stop:.1f}x better!")
```

**Expected:** Road car needs ~7.1 seconds and ~196 meters—2.5× longer!

---

### **Extension Challenge (Optional)**

**Experiment:**
1. Change `v0_kmh` to 100, then 300, then 400. How does stopping distance change?
2. What pattern do you notice? (Hint: d ∝ v₀²)
3. Set `mu = 1.2` (wet conditions). How much longer does braking take?

---

## **Stage 1B: Visualizing Braking Dynamics**

### **Learning Focus: Creating Clear Visualizations**
*Core Skills: matplotlib plotting, numpy arrays, professional plot formatting*

**Time Estimate:** 1-1.5 hours

**What You'll Build:** A plot showing how velocity decreases during braking.

**Assignment:** Create a professional-looking velocity vs time graph that shows the braking process.

---

### **Step 1: Create Time Array**

We'll use numpy to create an array of time points from 0 to t_stop:

```python
# Create 100 time points from start to stop
t = np.linspace(0, t_stop, 100)
```

**What this does:** our old friend `linspace` creates 100 evenly-spaced values between 0 and t_stop. This gives us smooth curves when plotting.

---

**Step 2: Calculate Velocity at Each Time Point**

Use the equation v(t) = v₀ - at:

```python
# Fill in the velocity equation:
v = ??? - ??? * t  # v(t) = v0 - a*t
<!-- PARTIAL_REVEAL -->
# Complete solution:
v = v0 - a_max * t  # Velocity decreases linearly with time
```

**What you've created:** An array of 100 velocity values, one for each time point.

---

**Step 3: Create the Plot**

Now let's visualize it! Fill in the plotting functions:

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))

# Fill in the plotting commands (use the hints below):
plt.???(t, v * 3.6, linewidth=2, color=COLORS['f1_red'])                 # Hint: creates line plot
plt.???('Time (s)', fontsize=12)                                         # Hint: labels x-axis
plt.???('Velocity (km/h)', fontsize=12)                                  # Hint: labels y-axis
plt.???('F1 Braking: Velocity vs Time', fontsize=14, fontweight='bold')  # Hint: adds title
plt.???(True, alpha=0.3)                                                 # Hint: adds grid lines

plt.axhline(y=0, color=COLORS['reference_black'], linestyle='--', alpha=0.5)  # Ground reference
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
<!-- PARTIAL_REVEAL -->
# Complete solution:
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.plot(t, v * 3.6, linewidth=2, color=COLORS['f1_red'])  # F1 red for dry/optimal
plt.xlabel('Time (s)', fontsize=12)
plt.ylabel('Velocity (km/h)', fontsize=12)
plt.title('F1 Braking: Velocity vs Time', fontsize=14, fontweight='bold')
plt.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
plt.axhline(y=0, color=COLORS['reference_black'], linestyle='--', alpha=0.5)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

**Plotting functions you may remember from past lessons:**
- `plt.plot()`: Creates line plots (x vs y)
- `plt.xlabel()` / `plt.ylabel()`: Add axis labels
- `plt.title()`: Adds plot title
- `plt.grid()`: Toggles grid lines (True/False, alpha controls transparency)

**Color note:** We used `COLORS['f1_red']` for dry/optimal braking. This consistent color coding will make all your plots professional and easy to read!

---

### **Checkpoint #2**

**What you should see:** A straight red line declining from 200 km/h to 0 over ~2.83 seconds.

**Why is it straight?** Because deceleration is constant (maximum braking), velocity decreases linearly: v = v₀ - (constant)×t

**Verification:**
```python
# Check velocity at halfway point
halfway_time = t_stop / 2
v_halfway = v0 - a_max * halfway_time
print(f"At t={halfway_time:.2f}s (halfway), velocity is {v_halfway*3.6:.1f} km/h")
# Expected: ~100 km/h (exactly half of 200 km/h)
```

---

### **Common Issues & Debugging**

**Problem:** "NameError: name 'np' is not defined"
- **Solution:** Run the import cell first

**Problem:** Stopping distance seems unrealistic
- **Solution:** Check that you converted km/h to m/s (divide by 3.6)

**Problem:** Plot shows velocity in m/s instead of km/h
- **Solution:** Multiply by 3.6 when plotting: `v * 3.6`

**Debugging tip:** Add print statements to check your work:
```python
print(f"v0 in m/s: {v0}")
print(f"a_max: {a_max}")
print(f"Expected pattern: velocity should decrease linearly")
```

---

### **Extension Challenge (Optional)**

If we want to really show off, let's do a little more math. Why not?

**Add a "G-Force Meter" annotation:**
```python
# Add text showing g-forces experienced
plt.text(0.7, 0.9, f'Driver feels: {a_max/g:.1f}g forward\n(~{a_max/g * 70:.0f} kg on 70kg driver)', 
         transform=plt.gca().transAxes,
         fontsize=10,
         bbox=dict(boxstyle='round', facecolor='yellow', alpha=0.7))
```

This shows the physical force drivers experience during braking!

**Question**: Does a heavier driver experience more or less G-force?

---

## **Stage 2: Braking Zone Visualization & Comparison**

### **Learning Focus: Distance-Velocity Relationship and Multi-Scenario Analysis**
*Core Skills: Position calculations, velocity-distance curves, function creation, comparative analysis*

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 hours

**What You'll Build:** Visualizations showing where the car is at each speed during braking, plus comparisons of different scenarios (dry vs wet, different speeds).

---

### **Step 1: Calculate Position During Braking**

So far we've looked at velocity vs *time*. Now let's find position vs *time*:

```python
# Create time array (same as before)
t = np.linspace(0, t_stop, 100)
v_t = v0 - a_max * t  # Velocity over time

# Fill in the position equation:
# Position: x(t) = v0*t - 0.5*a*t²
# (Same form as projectile motion, but horizontal!)
x_t = ??? * t - 0.5 * ??? * t**2
<!-- PARTIAL_REVEAL -->
# Complete solution:
x_t = v0 * t - 0.5 * a_max * t**2  # Position increases as car moves forward
```

**Connection to projectiles:**
- Same kinematic form: x = v0*t - 0.5*a*t²
- But here 'a' is horizontal deceleration (slowing the car)
- vs projectile where 'g' was vertical acceleration (pulling down)

---

**Step 2: The Critical Plot - Velocity vs Distance**

Here's the plot F1 engineers actually use: "At what speed is the car at each point in the braking zone?"

This requires a different approach. We'll calculate velocity as a function of *distance*, not time.

From the kinematic equation: v² = v₀² - 2ad

Solving for v: v = √(v₀² - 2ad)

```python
# Create distance array from 0 to stopping distance
x_array = np.linspace(0, d_stop, 100)

# Fill in the velocity-distance formula:
v_x = np.sqrt(??? - 2 * ??? * x_array)  # v(x) = sqrt(v0² - 2ax)
<!-- PARTIAL_REVEAL -->
# Complete solution:
x_array = np.linspace(0, d_stop, 100)
v_x = np.sqrt(v0**2 - 2 * a_max * x_array)  # Velocity as function of distance
```

Now plot it:

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(x_array, v_x * 3.6, linewidth=3, color=COLORS['f1_red'], label='Velocity')
plt.xlabel('Distance from Braking Point (m)', fontsize=12)
plt.ylabel('Velocity (km/h)', fontsize=12)
plt.title('F1 Braking Zone: Velocity vs Distance', fontsize=14, fontweight='bold')
plt.grid(True, alpha=0.3)

# Add reference lines - this helps put things in context
plt.axhline(y=v0_kmh, color='green', linestyle='--', alpha=0.5, 
            label=f'Entry: {v0_kmh} km/h')
plt.axvline(x=d_stop, color='red', linestyle='--', alpha=0.5, 
            label=f'Stop: {d_stop:.1f}m')

plt.legend(fontsize=11)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

**Engineering Insight:** This plot answers: "If I'm 50 meters from the corner, what speed should I be at?" It's fundamental for finding optimal braking points!

---

### **Checkpoint #3**

**What you should observe:**
- The curve is NOT straight (unlike velocity vs time)
- It's steeper at the beginning (rapid deceleration)
- Flattens as it approaches the stopping point
- Total distance: ~78.6 meters

**Challenge Question:** At the halfway point (39.3m), what's the velocity?
```python
halfway_dist = d_stop / 2
v_halfway = np.sqrt(v0**2 - 2 * a_max * halfway_dist)
print(f"At {halfway_dist:.1f}m, velocity is {v_halfway*3.6:.1f} km/h")
```

**Expected:** ~141 km/h (NOT 100 km/h!) This shows velocity doesn't decrease linearly with distance—it's quadratic!

---

### **Step 3: Create a Comparison Function**

Let's write a reusable function to calculate braking for any scenario:

```python
def calculate_braking(v0_kmh, mu, label, color):
    """
    Calculate braking parameters for given conditions.
    
    Parameters:
    - v0_kmh: Initial velocity (km/h)
    - mu: Coefficient of friction
    - label: Plot label
    - color: Plot color
    
    Returns: x_array, v_array (in km/h), d_stop, t_stop
    """
    # Fill in the calculations:
    v0 = v0_kmh / ???
    a_max = ??? * g
    t_stop = ??? / ???
    d_stop = ???**2 / (2 * ???)
    
    x_array = np.linspace(0, d_stop, 100)
    v_array = np.sqrt(v0**2 - 2 * a_max * x_array) * 3.6  # Convert to km/h
    
    return x_array, v_array, d_stop, t_stop
<!-- PARTIAL_REVEAL -->
# Complete solution:
def calculate_braking(v0_kmh, mu, label, color):
    """
    Calculate braking parameters for given conditions.
    
    Parameters:
    - v0_kmh: Initial velocity (km/h)
    - mu: Coefficient of friction
    - label: Plot label
    - color: Plot color
    
    Returns: x_array, v_array (in km/h), d_stop, t_stop
    """
    v0 = v0_kmh / 3.6
    a_max = mu * g
    t_stop = v0 / a_max
    d_stop = v0**2 / (2 * a_max)
    
    x_array = np.linspace(0, d_stop, 100)
    v_array = np.sqrt(v0**2 - 2 * a_max * x_array) * 3.6
    
    return x_array, v_array, d_stop, t_stop
```

**Rationale**: We don't want to have to write or even copy/paste all this math, every time we want this calculation. So make it a function!

---

**Step 4: Compare Dry vs Wet Conditions**

Now use the function to compare scenarios with our consistent color palette:

**AND**... We're going to introduce _looping_ for the first time, via Python's `for`. Check out
a quick illustration of the concept here before starting: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#for-statements

```python
# Define scenarios to compare (using our color palette!)
scenarios = [
    (200, 2.0, 'Dry (μ=2.0)', COLORS['f1_red']),        # Dry conditions
    (200, 1.2, 'Wet (μ=1.2)', COLORS['wet_blue']),      # Wet weather
    (200, 0.8, 'Very Wet (μ=0.8)', COLORS['rain_green'])  # Heavy rain
]

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))

for v0_kmh, mu, label, color in scenarios:
    x, v, d_stop, t_stop = calculate_braking(v0_kmh, mu, label, color)
    plt.plot(x, v, linewidth=2.5, label=f'{label} - Stop: {d_stop:.1f}m', color=color)

plt.xlabel('Distance from Braking Point (m)', fontsize=12)
plt.ylabel('Velocity (km/h)', fontsize=12)
plt.title('Braking Zone Comparison: Dry vs Wet Conditions', fontsize=14, fontweight='bold')
plt.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
plt.legend(fontsize=11)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

**What you should observe:**
- Red (dry, μ=2.0): ~78m stopping distance
- Blue (wet, μ=1.2): ~131m (67% longer!)
- Green (very wet, μ=0.8): ~196m (2.5× longer!)

**Real-world insight:** This is why F1 drivers brake MUCH earlier in the rain—tire grip drops dramatically. Notice how the color coding makes this instantly clear!

---

### **Extension Challenge (Optional)**

**Compare different entry speeds:**
```python
speeds = [150, 200, 250, 300]  # Different corner types
colors = [COLORS['rain_green'], COLORS['f1_red'], COLORS['damp_orange'], '#CC00CC']

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
for speed, color in zip(speeds, colors):
    x, v, d_stop, t_stop = calculate_braking(speed, 2.0, f'{speed} km/h', color)
    plt.plot(x, v, linewidth=2.5, label=f'{speed} km/h → {d_stop:.1f}m', color=color)

plt.xlabel('Distance (m)', fontsize=12)
plt.ylabel('Velocity (km/h)', fontsize=12)
plt.title('How Speed Affects Braking Distance (μ=2.0)', fontsize=14, fontweight='bold')
plt.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
plt.legend(fontsize=11)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

**Analysis:** Notice how doubling speed (150→300) quadruples stopping distance (45m→353m). That's the v² term in action!

---

## **Stage 3: The "Late Braking" Challenge**

### **Learning Focus: Optimization and Strategic Decision-Making**
*Core Skills: Functions, optimization logic, trade-off analysis, competitive thinking*

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 hours

**The Challenge:** In F1, you don't brake to a stop—you brake to a **target corner entry speed**. The question is: **How late can you brake and still hit that speed?**

This is where races are won and lost. Braking 5 meters later than your opponent = carrying more speed down the straight = overtaking opportunity!

---

### **Step 1: The Late Braking Problem**

**Scenario:** Lewis Hamilton vs Max Verstappen approaching Turn 1 at Monza:
- **Straight speed:** Both at 280 km/h
- **Target corner entry:** 120 km/h (any faster = run wide)
- **Question:** If Max brakes 10m later than Lewis, what advantage does he gain?

**The physics:** We need to find the distance required to slow from v₁ (straight) to v₂ (corner), not to zero.

From v² = v₁² - 2ad, solving for d: **d = (v₁² - v₂²) / (2a)**

---

**Step 2: Create the Braking Distance Function**

Copy this partially implemented function and see if you can figure out the missing values.

**Pro-Tip**: Notice how Python functions use a block delimited by `"""` to document what they do, what params they take, and what kind of value they return. This is a great practice because it makes it easy to understand how to use the function without remembering or caring about all the implementation. It might be overkill for simple stuff, but it's a good habit to get into - it also helps you think about your implementation before you write it.

```python
def braking_distance(v_entry_kmh, v_corner_kmh, mu):
    """
    Calculate minimum braking distance from entry speed to corner speed.
    
    Parameters:
    - v_entry_kmh: Speed when braking starts (km/h)
    - v_corner_kmh: Target corner entry speed (km/h)
    - mu: Coefficient of friction
    
    Returns:
    - distance: Required braking distance (meters)
    - time: Time spent braking (seconds)
    """
    # Fill in the conversions and calculations:

    v_entry = v_entry_kmh / 3.6

    a_max = mu * g

    time = (v_entry - v_corner) / a_max
    
    return distance, time
```

---

**Step 3: Test the Monza Scenario**

```python
# Monza Turn 1 braking
v_straight = 280  # km/h
v_corner = 120    # km/h
mu_dry = 2.0

d_brake, t_brake = braking_distance(v_straight, v_corner, mu_dry)

print("=" * 60)
print("MONZA TURN 1 - BRAKING ANALYSIS")
print("=" * 60)
print(f"Approach speed:     {v_straight} km/h")
print(f"Corner entry speed: {v_corner} km/h")
print(f"Speed to scrub:     {v_straight - v_corner} km/h")
print("-" * 60)
print(f"BRAKING POINT:      {d_brake:.1f} meters before turn-in")
print(f"BRAKING TIME:       {t_brake:.2f} seconds")
print("=" * 60)
```

**Expected output:**
- Braking distance: ~211.6 meters
- Braking time: ~2.27 seconds

**Reality check:** At 280 km/h, you're covering 77.8 m/s. Hitting a braking point within ±1 meter requires ±0.013 second reaction time precision!

---

### **Step 4: THE BATTLE - Lewis vs Max**

Now let's simulate the late braking advantage, featuring two hypothetical drivers named Lewis and Max.

```python
print("\n" + "=" * 70)
print("🏁 LATE BRAKING BATTLE 🏁")
print("=" * 70)

# Optimal braking point
d_optimal = d_brake

# Lewis: Brakes 10m early (conservative approach)
lewis_brake_point = d_optimal + 10

# Calculate Lewis's speed at the optimal braking point
# He's already been braking for 10m
v_lewis_at_optimal = np.sqrt((v_straight/3.6)**2 - 2 * (mu_dry * g) * 10) * 3.6

print(f"\n🏎️  LEWIS (conservative):")
print(f"  Brakes at:        {lewis_brake_point:.1f}m mark")
print(f"  Speed at optimal: {v_lewis_at_optimal:.1f} km/h")

print(f"\n🏎️  MAX (aggressive):")
print(f"  Brakes at:        {d_optimal:.1f}m mark")  
print(f"  Speed at optimal: {v_straight} km/h")

print(f"\n" + "=" * 70)
print(f"⚡ MAX'S ADVANTAGE:")
print(f"  Speed difference: {v_straight - v_lewis_at_optimal:.1f} km/h")
print(f"  Time advantage:   ~{10 / (v_straight/3.6):.3f} seconds")
print(f"  Position gain:    ~{10:.1f} meters")
print("=" * 70)

print("\n💡 INSIGHT: Braking just 10m later means carrying ~26 km/h more speed")
print("at the optimal point. That's the difference between P1 and P2!")
```

**What this shows:** Late braking isn't just about bravery—it's physics. Every meter counts!

---

### **Checkpoint #4**

**Gamified Challenge:** Can you find the braking point for these famous corners?

```python
corners = {
    "Monaco Hairpin": (180, 50),      # Slowest corner in F1
    "Silverstone Copse": (310, 200),  # High-speed corner
    "Spa Bus Stop": (270, 90),        # Heavy braking chicane
}

print("\n" + "=" * 60)
print("🏆 F1 CORNER BRAKING CHALLENGE 🏆")
print("=" * 60)

for corner_name, (v_in, v_out) in corners.items():
    d, t = braking_distance(v_in, v_out, 2.0)
    print(f"\n{corner_name}:")
    print(f"  {v_in} → {v_out} km/h")
    print(f"  Braking zone: {d:.1f} meters")
    print(f"  Braking time: {t:.2f} seconds")

print("=" * 60)
```

**Challenge:** Which corner has the longest braking zone? Can you explain why based on the (v₁² - v₂²) term?

---

### **Step 5: Visualize Corner Entry (Simplified Version)**

Let's create a simple visualization first, then build complexity:

```python
# Simple braking zone visualization
def plot_simple_braking_zone(v_straight, v_corner, mu):
    """Simple visualization of braking zone."""
    
    # Calculate parameters
    d, t = braking_distance(v_straight, v_corner, mu)
    v1 = v_straight / 3.6
    v2 = v_corner / 3.6
    a_max = mu * g
    
    # Create arrays
    x = np.linspace(0, d, 200)
    v_x = np.sqrt(v1**2 - 2 * a_max * x) * 3.6
    
    # Plot (using our color palette!)
    plt.figure(figsize=(12, 5))
    plt.plot(x, v_x, linewidth=3, color=COLORS['f1_red'])
    plt.fill_between(x, 0, v_x, alpha=0.2, color=COLORS['f1_red'], label='Braking zone')
    
    # Mark key points
    plt.axvline(x=0, color='green', linewidth=2, label='Braking point (latest)')
    plt.axvline(x=d, color='blue', linewidth=2, label='Turn-in point')
    
    plt.xlabel('Distance to Corner (m)', fontsize=12)
    plt.ylabel('Velocity (km/h)', fontsize=12)
    plt.title(f'Braking Zone: {v_straight}→{v_corner} km/h | {d:.1f}m zone', 
              fontsize=13, fontweight='bold')
    plt.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
    plt.legend()
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()

# Test it!
plot_simple_braking_zone(280, 120, 2.0)
```

**Extension:** Try visualizing all three corners from the challenge above!

---

## **Stage 4: Weather Impact Analysis**

### **Learning Focus: Multi-Scenario Comparison and Decision-Making**
*Core Skills: Data analysis, comparative visualization, strategic thinking*

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 hours

**The Goal:** Build a comparison tool showing how weather dramatically changes braking strategy—the kind of analysis F1 teams do when rain starts mid-race.

---

### **Step 1: Define Track Corners**

Create a simplified F1 track with realistic braking zones:

```python
# Simplified track with 5 key braking zones
track_corners = {
    "Turn 1": (300, 80),    # Heavy braking from high speed
    "Turn 3": (260, 140),   # Medium-speed corner
    "Turn 6": (280, 100),   # Chicane
    "Turn 9": (310, 220),   # Fast corner (less braking)
    "Turn 12": (200, 60),   # Hairpin
}

# Weather conditions (mapped to our color palette!)
conditions = {
    "Dry": (2.0, COLORS['f1_red']),
    "Damp": (1.5, COLORS['damp_orange']),
    "Wet": (1.2, COLORS['wet_blue']),
    "Very Wet": (0.8, COLORS['rain_green'])
}
```

---

### **Step 2: Calculate and Compare (Simple Bar Chart First)**

Let's start with a clear, simple visualization before getting fancy:

```python
# Calculate dry vs wet for all corners
corner_names = list(track_corners.keys())
dry_distances = []
wet_distances = []

for corner_name, (v_in, v_out) in track_corners.items():
    d_dry, _ = braking_distance(v_in, v_out, 2.0)
    d_wet, _ = braking_distance(v_in, v_out, 1.2)
    dry_distances.append(d_dry)
    wet_distances.append(d_wet)

# Create comparison bar chart (using our color palette!)
x_pos = np.arange(len(corner_names))
width = 0.35

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 6))
bars1 = ax.bar(x_pos - width/2, dry_distances, width, 
               label='Dry (μ=2.0)', color=COLORS['f1_red'], alpha=0.8)
bars2 = ax.bar(x_pos + width/2, wet_distances, width, 
               label='Wet (μ=1.2)', color=COLORS['wet_blue'], alpha=0.8)

# Add values on bars
for bars in [bars1, bars2]:
    for bar in bars:
        height = bar.get_height()
        ax.text(bar.get_x() + bar.get_width()/2, height,
                f'{height:.0f}m', ha='center', va='bottom', fontsize=10)

ax.set_xlabel('Corner', fontsize=12)
ax.set_ylabel('Braking Distance (m)', fontsize=12)
ax.set_title('Dry vs Wet: Braking Distance Comparison', 
             fontsize=14, fontweight='bold')
ax.set_xticks(x_pos)
ax.set_xticklabels(corner_names)
ax.legend(fontsize=11)
ax.grid(True, alpha=0.3, axis='y')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Print percentage increases
print("\n" + "=" * 60)
print("BRAKING DISTANCE INCREASE IN WET CONDITIONS")
print("=" * 60)
for i, corner in enumerate(corner_names):
    increase = wet_distances[i] - dry_distances[i]
    percent = (increase / dry_distances[i]) * 100
    print(f"{corner:15s} +{increase:5.1f}m  (+{percent:4.1f}%)")
print("=" * 60)
```

**What you should see:** Every corner needs ~65-67% more distance in wet conditions. Heavy braking zones show the largest absolute increases. The red/blue color coding makes the comparison immediately clear!

---

### **Step 3: Lap Time Impact**

Calculate the time penalty for one lap:

```python
# Calculate total braking time per lap
total_time_dry = sum([braking_distance(speeds[0], speeds[1], 2.0)[1] 
                      for speeds in track_corners.values()])
total_time_wet = sum([braking_distance(speeds[0], speeds[1], 1.2)[1] 
                      for speeds in track_corners.values()])

penalty_per_lap = total_time_wet - total_time_dry

print("\n" + "=" * 60)
print("⏱️  LAP TIME IMPACT ANALYSIS")
print("=" * 60)
print(f"Total braking time (dry): {total_time_dry:.2f}s per lap")
print(f"Total braking time (wet): {total_time_wet:.2f}s per lap")
print(f"Time penalty in wet:      +{penalty_per_lap:.2f}s per lap")
print(f"\nOver 50-lap race:")
print(f"  Total penalty: +{penalty_per_lap * 50:.1f}s")
print(f"  That's {(penalty_per_lap * 50)/60:.1f} minutes slower!")
print("=" * 60)
```

**Engineering Insight:** This is why wet weather completely changes race strategy—braking alone can cost 2-3 minutes over a race distance!

---

### **Step 4: Advanced Track Visualization (Optional)**

Now that we understand the basics, here's the full overhead track view:

```python
def plot_track_overhead():
    """
    Overhead track view showing dry vs wet braking zones.
    Uses consistent color palette for professional presentation.
    """
    fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(16, 6))
    
    # Simplified track positions
    corner_positions = [100, 300, 500, 750, 950]
    corner_labels = list(track_corners.keys())
    
    for ax, condition, mu, color, title_color in [
        (ax1, 'DRY', 2.0, COLORS['f1_red'], 'black'),
        (ax2, 'WET', 1.2, COLORS['wet_blue'], COLORS['wet_blue'])
    ]:
        ax.set_title(f'{condition} CONDITIONS (μ={mu})', 
                     fontsize=14, fontweight='bold', color=title_color)
        ax.set_xlim(-50, 1050)
        ax.set_ylim(-20, 100)
        ax.set_xlabel('Track Position (m)', fontsize=12)
        ax.axhline(y=0, color=COLORS['reference_black'], linewidth=3)
        
        for i, (corner_name, speeds) in enumerate(track_corners.items()):
            d, _ = braking_distance(speeds[0], speeds[1], mu)
            corner_pos = corner_positions[i]
            
            # Draw braking zone
            ax.add_patch(plt.Rectangle((corner_pos - d, -10), d, 20, 
                                       color=color, alpha=0.3))
            ax.plot([corner_pos - d, corner_pos], [0, 0], 
                    color=color, linewidth=4)
            ax.scatter([corner_pos], [0], color='blue', s=200, zorder=5)
            ax.text(corner_pos, 15, corner_labels[i], 
                    ha='center', fontsize=11, fontweight='bold')
        
        ax.set_yticks([])
        ax.grid(True, alpha=0.3, axis='x')
    
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()

plot_track_overhead()
```

**What this shows:** How braking zones nearly double in the wet (red vs blue), completely changing the track's rhythm and braking markers. The consistent color coding makes the impact immediately visible!

---

### **Checkpoint #5**

**Challenge:** If it starts raining mid-race, which corners become the most dangerous (largest absolute distance increase)? Which corners are relatively "safer" (smallest change)?

**Extension:** Add intermediate conditions (damp, μ=1.5) and see how drivers must adjust as the track dries. Try to do it yourself, first. If stuck, ask the Colab AI how to accomplish the specific thing you're attempting.

---

## **Stage 5: Interactive Braking Calculator**

### **Learning Focus: Interactive Engineering Tools**
*Core Skills: ipywidgets, real-time visualization, parameter exploration*

**Time Estimate:** 1-2 hours

**The Goal:** Create an interactive tool that updates in real-time as you adjust sliders—just like F1 simulation software.

---

### **Step 1: Import Widget Tools**

We're going to do some fancier UI stuff, so we'll add another library.

**Pro-Tip**: Open this in another tab for reference: https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

```python
from ipywidgets import interact, FloatSlider, IntSlider
```

---

### **Step 2: Create Interactive Function**

This is a huge function. Before copying and pasting, try to read it. Note any sections that you don't quite understand. After you paste it, ask the Colab AI what that line or lines is doing. Try to understand the whole function before evaluating it.

```python
def interactive_braking(v_entry_kmh=280, v_corner_kmh=120, mu=2.0):
    """
    Interactive braking calculator with real-time updates.
    Uses consistent color coding for professional presentation.
    """
    # Calculate parameters
    d_brake, t_brake = braking_distance(v_entry_kmh, v_corner_kmh, mu)
    a_max = mu * g
    
    # Create visualization
    v1 = v_entry_kmh / 3.6
    v2 = v_corner_kmh / 3.6
    x = np.linspace(0, d_brake, 200)
    v_x = np.sqrt(v1**2 - 2 * a_max * x) * 3.6

---

### **Final Checkpoint**

**You should have:**
- Interactive sliders that update plots in real-time
- **Color-coded plots** that change based on grip level (red=dry, blue=wet, green=very wet)
- Performance metrics display
- Comparison to road car performance

**Challenge Scenarios to Try:**
1. **Monaco Hairpin:** v_entry=180, v_corner=50, μ=2.0 (should show red)
2. **Wet Monza T1:** v_entry=280, v_corner=120, μ=1.2 (should show blue)
3. **Degraded Tires:** v_entry=280, v_corner=120, μ=1.6 (should show orange)

**Can you find:** The minimum grip (μ) needed to brake from 300→100 km/h in under 150 meters?

---

## **Project Deliverables**

If we wanted this Colab notebook to become a portfolio piece, here are some things to consider:

### **1. Code (Readable, Well-Commented)**
- All stages completed and working
- Clear physics explanations in comments
- Meaningful variable names
- Function docstrings
- **Consistent use of COLORS palette throughout**

### **2. Visualizations**
- Velocity vs time plot (Stage 1B)
- Velocity vs distance braking zone (Stage 2)
- Dry vs wet comparison (Stage 2 & 4)
- Corner entry visualization (Stage 3)
- Track overhead view (Stage 4, if attempted)
- Interactive tool screenshot (Stage 5, if attempted)
- **All plots use consistent color coding**

### **3. Written Responses**

**You can use Text cells to explore some Physics Questions in line. For example:**
1. Explain why `a_max = μg` is independent of car mass. What does this mean for F1 vs GT car braking?
2. **Why can F1 tires have μ > 1?** Explain the three physical reasons that allow this.
3. The stopping distance formula contains v². If you double your speed from 150→300 km/h, how much does braking distance increase? Calculate specific values to support your answer.
4. Compare braking from 280→120 km/h in dry (μ=2.0) vs wet (μ=1.2). Calculate both distances and explain the physical reason for the difference.

**Strategic Analysis:**
5. **The Late Braking Battle:** Driver A brakes at 220m before Turn 1 (280→120 km/h, μ=2.0). Driver B brakes at the optimal point. Calculate:
   - The optimal braking distance
   - Driver A's speed at the optimal braking point
   - Driver B's advantage in km/h and meters
6. Using the 5-corner track from Stage 4, calculate total time spent braking per lap in:
   - Dry conditions (μ=2.0)
   - Wet conditions (μ=1.2)
   What's the lap time penalty from braking alone?

**Real-World Application:**
7. An F1 driver overshoots their braking point by 15 meters. They were approaching at 300 km/h for a corner requiring 100 km/h entry (μ=2.0). What speed will they carry into the corner? Will they make it?

**Reflection:**
8. What surprised you most about F1 braking physics?
9. How does this project change your understanding of what drivers must do lap after lap?
10. If you were designing a driver training program, how would you use this simulator?

---

### **Exceptional (Goes Above and Beyond)**
- ✅ All of above, plus:
- ✅ Original extension (combined braking+cornering, downforce, etc.)
- ✅ Real F1 data comparison or validation (research where this can be found - would be great to have this or even virtualized (sim) data)
- ✅ Could serve as teaching resource

## **Extensions & Next Steps**

After completing this project, there are several areas to explore next:

1. **Friction Circle:** Model combined braking + cornering
2. **Downforce:** Add speed-dependent grip (μ increases with v²)
3. **Brake Temperature:** Model heat buildup and fade
4. **Trail Braking:** Optimize brake release curve into corners
5. **Full Lap Sim:** String corners together with acceleration
6. **Tire Degradation:** Model grip loss over stint
7. **Race Strategy:** Optimize fuel vs lap time trade-offs

Let's go! **You got this! 🏎️💨**
